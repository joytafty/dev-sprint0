Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer: 
Line1 imports all items in TurtleWorld module.
Line2 creates TurtleWorld instance called world.
Line3 creates Turtle instance called bob.
Line4 tells TurtleWorld instance to wait for user input

These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer: The arguments of polygon are: 
	bob - type turtle
	l - type float
	n - type int

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: The two turtle functions are
	fd - moves turtle forward
	lt - turns turtle leftward

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer:
	The arguments of polyline are: 
	bob - type turtle
	n - type int
	length - type float
	angle - type float

Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: 
	fd(turtle,r)
	lt(turtle)

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer: 
	rt(turtle)
	bk(turtle,r)

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer:
	postcondition
